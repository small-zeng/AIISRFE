## Unity Project in Windows

Please refer to [Install Unity and Visual Studio on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/visualstudio/gamedev/unity/get-started/getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-for-unity?pivots=windows). Our environment includes Unity 2019.4.40 and Visual Studio 2019. Please make sure installed environment is not lower than this version.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/small-zeng/AIISRFE.git
cd AIISRFE
```

### Install with conda in Ubuntu

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate monosdf
```


1. Run Unity Project

```bash
After install Unity Editor and Visual Studio, you can start it by click RUN button in Unity Editor.
```

2. Open one terminal and start reconstruction service:

```bash
cd monosdfServer_unity
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:7000
```

3. Open another terminal and start planner service:

Make sure that the Windows and Ubuntu machines are on the same local network. The planner is modified from [Fuel](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL/).

```bash 
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch exploration_manager rviz.launch
roslaunch exploration_manager exploration_multi_room.launch
```
